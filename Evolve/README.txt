Evolve - Evolution Simulator  (Copyright 2015 Brian Macker)

This program was written using Python 3.5 on Windows 8.  It has not be tested outside of that environment.  [A specific concern outside of Windows would be the turtle graphics display width and height vs setting of world coordinate being incompatible on other operating systems. Try at your own risk.]

All libraries used are standard to python (random, turtle, and math).

Environment setup:
Download Python 3.5 on Windows 8 and install.  Set the path environment according to the python instructions.

On Windows you can double click on display.pyw to launch it from Windows explorer.  You can also use the command prompt to enter c:\Evolve\display.pyw and hit enter.   

When launched a display will come up.  Follow the directions in the header of the display to play around.  Have fun!
